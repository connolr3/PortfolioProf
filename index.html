        <h3>“Neurodivergent Gaming: A Review, Discussion and Proposed Research Design” (Master's Thesis)</h3>
        <P><b>Abstract</b> </P>


        <p>In 2021 Spiel and Gerling conducted an impressive literature review calling out researchers for the lack of research into the enjoyment of games for neurodivergent populations. They found that the bulk of research is conducted from a medical standpoint,
            for reasons relating to therapy, diagnosis, or education. This paper extends their research up to 2023. Much of their findings still hold true. Researchers still take a corrective approach - fixing the perceived deficits of disabilities. However
            small shifts were observed towards the ideals of neurodiversity. Games are more adaptable to users’ needs and new used-focused design methods are being utilised. This success was hindered slightly by COVID-19 which caused participant recruitment
            difficulties and a tendency towards single player games. Another slight shift is observed in language around disability. Spiel and Gerling found much of the research conducted before 2021 used deficit focused language. This paper finds a slight
            shift towards more social and individual language. Yet many papers still use outdated language and hold perspectives on disability not held by much of the disabled population themselves. The concept of neurodiversity is still under-utilised
            and there is much room for improvement.</p>
        <p>Following this review, it is clear games are very rarely researched for the context of fun when it comes to neurodiverse users. Yet the primary use of games is fun. Improving the enjoyment of gaming is extremely well researched for the general
            neurotypical population so why not for the neurodiverse population too? Thus, this paper makes some initial steps into investigating and improving the ‘fun’ of games for neurodiverse populations. Following the literature review some areas
            are deduced to be under-researched. The paper discusses eight of these areas - features of ‘neurodivergent gaming’ - purely in the context of fun. These areas include preferred game genres, most enjoyable gameplay features and neurodiverse
            representation in games. Insights are considered from the neurodivergent community through public forums. A research survey is designed to further investigate these areas.</p>
        <p>This paper presents the necessary groundwork for future research to be conducted into neurodivergent gaming. It highlights gaps in the current research and presents new areas of interest to explore using a designed survey.</p>
