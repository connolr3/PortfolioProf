        <h3>Intro the Retroverse: A VR Experience</h3>
        <h4>Exhibitied at IDM Showcase, Beta Festival and European Researcher's Night</h4>
        <p>
            "Lost in the Retroverse" is a Virtual Reality experience that takes you through the grief of losing a loved one and immerses you in the nostalgia of iconic video games like Tetris, Super Mario, and Pacman. Inspired by the most iconic games of the 80s,
            it presents the adventure of Alex, a teenager who experiences the loss of his father but soon discovers Retroverse: a gaming dimension that keeps his father's memory alive. The primary goal of this project was to design and create a visually
            stunning experience, that would immerse the user in an imaginary journey to a virtual world. Lost in the Retroverse is comprised of a variety of creative components: Narrative, 3D Modelling, Game Mechanics and User Interactions, Audio, Graphic
            Design and Illustrations.

        </p>
        <p>

            This project was exhibited as part of the annual Interactive Digital Media Showcase at the Science Gallery in Trinity College Dublin, during European Researchers' Night 2023 and the Beta Festival—a celebration of art and technology in Dublin. It received
            favorable appraisals from both academics and exhibition attendees.

        <h3>Making neurodiverse-friendly video games (Research)</h3>
        <p>“Designing Neurodiverse-Friendly Games” is a project that will examine the design, enjoyment, and use of video games amongst neurodivergent people. The project aims to uncover what aspects of games are appealing and unappealing to neurodivergent
            folks - many of whom are notorious gamers. Once this is uncovered the project will research ways to incorporate this into game design. The project can be thought about using two key research questions;</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is it about video games that is appealing to neurodivergent people and how can we include more of this?</li>
                <li>What is it about video games that is unappealing to neurodivergent people and how can we limit this?</li>
            </ul> The target consumer of gaming industries includes a large population of neurodivergents. In addition to this a recent study found that 18% of people employed in the gaming industry are neurodivergent (Taylor, 2022). It is therefore interesting
            that very little research is done on ensuring enjoyment for neurodivergents in the game design process (4% of 151 papers, according to a recent review by Spiel & Gerling, 2020!). It is only beneficial to the industry to acknowledge this and
            incorporate it into their game design and development methodologies. Video games and neurodivergence is a well-researched field. However, the bulk of this research is from a healthcare or educational perspective. Most (over half in one study
            of relevant papers) medicinal research focuses on using video games to pinpoint the perceived deficits of neurodivergent (most research is on Autism) people and correct it (Spiel & Gerling, 2020). The other main field is education. Video games
            are used as an educational tool to ‘teach’ neurodivergent children how to be more social or act appropriately in a classroom. Most of this research uses an outdated and negative approach - driven by a medical educational purpose. One review
            found that over half of them involved a majority of male autistic participants. The current research is not adequate. The primary use of video games is at-home-enjoyment, not medical or educational. Yet little research is done on how to ensure
            video games are appealing and accessible to neurodiverse people. Even gaming companies themselves do not conduct research into the actual enjoyment and play preferences of a huge proportion of their consumers - the neurodivergent perspective.
