        <h4>A Closer Look & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>My art is ink-based and usually revolves around landscapes and scenes; I believe the fine level of detail is its defining feature. I wanted to submit some works that showcase this and break down common stereotypes around people with ADHD. We can
            be disciplined, we can focus long enough to create amazing things - all we need is clarity of purpose. Our disabilities don 't define us, but they may help us - I strongly believe my ADHD and ASD have gifted me with my eye for detail, and
            my ability to translate it onto paper." </p>

        <div class="poem">
            It was dawn<br> The sky was twilight<br> I walked along the path to the ocean<br> Reached the oak trees.<br>
            <br> I looked at the greatness of the forest,<br> Through a drop of dew<br> Resting in silence and peace<br> On a young silky leaf.<br>
            <br> I asked the dew drop,<br> What happened?<br> What do I see?<br> Why is the world upside down?<br> Why everything is curvy?<br> Are trees rooted in the sky?<br> You little waterdrop!<br> Tell me.<br> Am I delusional?<br> Or this is your
            magic?
            <br>
            <br> I pondered in silence<br> Astonished, amazed, speechless, and confused.<br>
            <br> Then I heard a voice in my head saying:<br> Look closer!<br> The world is still the same<br> Also, the jungle and the trees<br> No matter what angle,<br> No matter what shape.<br>
            <br> Through a dew drop<br> A binocular or a magnifier<br> It does not matter<br> The world is still the same<br>
            <br> It’s your perspective that matters<br> And your perception<br> It’s okay if dew drop makes the world looks unusual<br> The world is still the same<br> Nothing changes the reality<br> Do not let anything<br> Makes you believe that you
            are delusional<br> That you are abnormal.<br> You are unique<br> You are exceptional,<br> You are brilliant<br> You are the best version of you.<br>

        <p><b>Alt Text:</b> The painting is watercolour and lined with black. It depicts a train station, viewed from a side on angle. To the foreground is a person waiting for the train, wearing grey headphones and engrossed in reading. Also to the foreground
            is a Dart train, in which Totoro and No Name are visibly sitting in the driver's carriage. To the background is a blurred crowd, and a sunset or a sunrise, whichever you prefer. To the side is a sign - it is cut off from the viewpoint but
            reads "Express Locomotives - One Stop Never Stop - Locomoting since 1999".</p>
        <h4>Express Locomotives & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>Unique: ASD is an invisible disability but to me autistic people always have a little uniqueness or sparkle to them. I think we have a sixth sense in sensing kindred spirits - why most of us tend to unknowingly flock together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perspective: While not perhaps the intended interpretation, I tried to incorporate physical perspective into my drawing. The train station is viewed from a side on angle.

                My Invisible Disability, <br> is Divisible by my Ability. <br> My Invisible Disability, <br> isn’t my Inequality. <br> My Invisible Disability, <br> doesn’t diminish my Capability. <br> My Invisible Disability, <br> is my strength and

        <h4>My Invisible Disability & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>I have accepted my invisible disabilities and because of this I have gained one quality that has helped me accomplish so much in my life and that is persistence. Knowing this about myself gives me the strength to wake up every morning and try
            to achieve my dreams. Even as a disabled mature student in Trinity, I am still learning how to build myself and my ways of being in the world again. I am better able to accept my disabilities and other parts of myself that I couldn’t before.
            Learning new things in has started the process of understanding myself as autistic all over again. Learning new things can be an intense psychological experience, a bit like setting the reset button on your sense of self. Although, my anxiety
            and my depression will never go away, that’s one exam I am always going to fail, no matter what.</p>

        <h4>Joy & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>I made this piece after a period of prolonged illness that impeded my mobility. I was unable to properly walk or stand for anything other than short bursts. I made this piece on the first day I was able to walk independently without severe pain
            because the amount of joy I felt in the simple motion made me feel like I was dancing. To the able-bodied, walking is a simple act but to me, it was exhilarating. </p>

        <p>My poem is based on someone who needs to use a wheelchair for everyday life and how and that it will take them longer to complete everyday tasks. It's important to know this as people with disabilities need longer time and we need everybody to
            be a bit more understanding even with the hidden disabilities which is what I have myself</p>

            <p>
                My perspective is hidden but not my age. <br> This is not a disability though may be viewed as such. <br> I watch how you view me as you try to decipher my hidden perspective-my secret concern. <br> But you can’t- it’s not allowed. <br>                So, you wait for me to disclose and when I don’t you seem disappointed. <br> With me. <br> My unique perspective is born out of my unique life, <br> I am not young, I do not have a visible disability, I am normal, I am not old, <br> I
                just am, <br> Accept me as you would another. <br> Do not ask me why I am here, <br> I belong here, disability and all <br> I do not owe you an explanation. <br> I am in pain, <br> Almost every day, <br> I walk with pain as my skin, <br>                I am tired. <br> I am not old. <br> And yet out there you would love to know so that you can KNOW me. <br> But I am not my disability, <br> I just am, <br> If you accept me then you accept that you do not know all of me as I do not know
                all of you <br> That is alright-With ME. <br> Acceptance is not yours to give nor mine to receive. <br> Acceptance must be the norm. <br> I do not know why you are here, I never ask. <br> Do not ask me why I am here, <br> I belong here,
                disability and all <br> I do not owe you an explanation. <br> My perspective is hidden but not my age. <br> Accept me as you would another, <br> Do not ask me why I am here, <br> I belong here, disability and all, <br> I do not owe you
                an explanation. <br>

        <h4>Acceptance & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>This poem draws out how every person living with difference understood as disability in society is unique. No two people are the same even if they have the same diagnosis. Perspectives from the media or others are dangerous as society tends towards
            sweeping generalizations for their own comfort. The voice of the person is rarely heard as we are talked about and talked to much of the time. This poem allows that invisible person a voice while still maintaining their privacy as is their
            right. </p>

        <p> <b>Alt Text:</b>Two portrait digital art pieces. On the left, a blue ceramic bowl of oranges with green leaves. This sits on a blue podium, where one orange sits on its own. The background is a light cream shade. On the right, a close up of the
            same image. The single orange on the podium takes the focus as it is bruised, textured and discoloured. Behind it, the blue bowl is visibly damaged with scratches, missing paint and bumps. </p>
        <h4>Citric Mirage & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>It is up to the viewer whether they see it or not. These still life images portray the same scene, but different perspectives. The first photo is idyllic, soft and easy to look at. The second is bruised, textured and fills the viewer with unease.
            That’s okay though, because you can just refocus on the first image and pretend you never saw the rotting orange and damaged bowl. </p>
        <p>I have found benefits to being able to shift focus away from my invisible disability throughout my life. I felt like I had control over it; a sense of autonomy. I was once in the bowl of oranges, hiding among the crowd. I chose to change this
            and I have more in common with the orange outside of the bowl. Now that I have began to sit confidently in my identify as a disabled person, I have realised the limitations of that agency. </p>
        <p>Even when I choose to make my disability visible, many people still do not see or view it in a different way than I do. This has been a surprising perspective to gain. </p>

        <p> <b>Alt Text:</b> Braided silver wire is circled into a basket shape. The left side is finished and woven together with ribbon, while the right side is stretched, misshapen and gapping. The very end of the wire at the top begins to unravel and
            the edges are left sharp.

        <h4>Interwoven & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>Being partially paralyzed is not something people tend to notice about me at first. My left side can normally compensate, but things slip through the cracks. The ribbon on the left side of my basket represents the strain I feel from my movement,
            while the right side of the basket is lose and coming apart, unable to perform its purpose due to the gaps. This piece is representative of years of posture, gait, and most importantly my mindset as every physical choice I make I have to ask
            myself if I can safely perform that task, or if I will slip, trip, and fall through those gaps. </p>

            <p>
                Steep, cracked, and jagged, it stands,<br> Taller than the clouds, wider than the seas.<br> The night sky looms overhead, yet there are no stars,<br> While dark and grey clouds slip down its rough edges.<br> The only light peeks from within
                the cracks along its face,<br> As if trying to reach out its arms to me.<br><br> I look below, I see no floor,<br> I look above, I see no end,<br> I stand somewhere along its face.<br><br> All I know is that I must climb.
                <br><br> Even if I lose grip and slip,<br> Even if debris comes crashing down,<br> Even if my hands bruise, my bones crack, my arms tear,<br>
                <br> I must keep my hold.<br>
                <br> When does this end, where does this even bring me.

                find myself, and I recall why I am here, and why I am climbing at all,<br>
                <br> So that one day, I can reach this summit,<br> And on that day,<br> I will finally be able to truly say Hello,<br> I will finally be able to Laugh and Live,<br> I will finally be able to be the best version of myself.<br><br> And all

        </div>
        <h4>That I Must Climb & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>The poem is titled 'That I Must Climb' and is inspired by how people, particularly those with disabilities, must work hard to achieve the same level of happiness and self-fulfilment as what we would think is normal. We may feel separated from
            the world, and everyone in it simply because we feel as if we alone are the issue, and that we alone have a seemingly impossible and neverending task of trying to maintain ourselves while everyone else simply lives on, leaving us behind. Sometimes
            we forget where we are even headed, we forget the main component that dictates who we are as an individual and who we are as a part of the community we build around ourselves. With a glimpse into that vision, we can be motivated to continue
            to improve, to learn, to live, and to become the best version of ourselves, and thus in turn inspire others, so that they may find themselves.</p>

        <h4>A Journey to My Future & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>From a Young Age, I struggled in school because I have a learning disability and speech impediment. I have SNAs in classes to help me, and I was grateful for the help but always wished I could have been in class and working on my own like the
            other students. I was in the mainstream class for maths for a while but then I got moved to another class. I really like the teachers in the one to one class. I always wanted to be in the mainstream class, but would have struggled so much
            in a mainstream class.</p>
        <p>Now I am in Trinity College I am doing the same work as everyone I am loving the course. I am on the road to getting a job that will hopefully be accomodating to me and my disability. That is why I think everyone has a right to education, even
            those people who have a disability where you want to be your life. If it takes longer it will be worth it. I think I am in a course that suits me well and I have made new friends. We are all in it together. It feels like a community and we
            all help each other. </p>

        <div class="poem">
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the show is about to start, for your pleasure on front stage, let me check the chart, playing the expected socially constructed role, at your mercy, our leading actress, please, take a curtsy. Wearing
                her mask, she will abandon her desires, this fake, fraudster, cheat is a woman who conspires. So over to you, the stage is all yours to reclaim, don’t slip, keep your audience entertained. Thank you for such a warm introduction, I am ready
                to mould, negotiate; undergo reconstruction. This mask, I use to cover up each and every flaw, it’s my magic prop to prevent me drawing the short straw. It hides all of my traumas and my true identity, to avoid shame and stigma and keep
                some integrity. Even though this mask is emotionally demanding, the show must go on, to avoid any misunderstanding. She is hiding her deficits, her disorder of the mind, restlessness, inattentiveness and distracted combined. She struggles
                with learning, immature, impatient and impulsive, zones out, too loud, too fast, interrupts and compulsive. Can’t sit still, hyperactive, with a racing brain, a peculiar character, that’s hard to explain. Seeking recognition from others,
                to belong, yet defiantly resisting, despising conformity… ITS WRONG! </p>

            <p>But… I have the ability to hyper-focus with non-linear thinking, that’s the tip of the iceberg, my ship is not sinking. Not constrained by conformity, outside of the box thinker, driven for self-fulfilment, a positive risk taker. Brave, inspiring,
                resilient, inclusive, authentic, Intelligent, fun, empathetic, a real romantic. Quirky, entertaining, humorous, creative, with passionate vision, truly innovative. She wants to bring all of ‘me’ to the surface, but then risks losing her
                life’s purpose. Do you really think you will win the identity battle? Inequality, suffering, never fitting in, all of this - dismantle? Is a menu for loneliness, rejection, abandonment and exclusion, is telling people this prosecution,
                really a solution? The power of a label can literally imprison, people focus on the misconceptions of your condition. I am so desperate to fit in and find a ‘we’, NO! I’m not, I despise it! I rebel! I disagree. You’ve given me two voices,
                one with low self-esteem, but I’m pushing that off stage, I just want to be me. I’m closing the curtain, it’s the finale, taking a bow – I AM FREE! I am a mother, a partner, a student, an educator, working class, I am removing this final
                mask, And I am showing all of you, that I have A-D-H-D. </p>
        </div>
        <h4>The Finale & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>This poetry shows my struggle with 'coming out' after receiving a diagnosis of ADHD. I worried about the misconceptions of ADHD and as a result how others may have judged me and any negative impact this may have had. Although I battled it out
            with myself, I realised that ADHD has made me who I am, and although I have challenges, I would never change me or having ADHD, as I am unique, proud and owning it. </p>

        <p> <b>Alt Text: </b>The clay sculpture is of a female conductor who is looking upwards while shielding her eyes with her right hand, her left hand is slightly bent and curved out in front of her torso in 3rd position. The woman’s upper torso is covered
            in a bodice of small flowers which flow into a ballgown skirt adorned with four large flowers curving down the center of the skirt. There are musical notes anchored to the left and right sides of the dress. The hem of the dress is sculpted
            into a wavey pattern

        <h4>The Conductor & Unique Perspective</h4>
        <p>My clay piece describes how I feel to have adhd. I feel like a conductor of an orchestra, trying to organise a large number of different instruments. I see these instruments as my thoughts and how I feel overwhelmed with 101 things to think about
            at every moment. This is the biggest impact my adhd has on me. </p>
