        <p class="concept">2023 was the second year of Trinity’s Disability Art Exhibition. Last year the exhibition took place in the newly opened Hamilton Zóin Mac Leinn with the theme “Defining Disability”. The exhibition is a collaboration between the Trinity Ability
            Co_op and the Students Union. The exhibition is run during Disability Awareness Week (28th Nov – 2nd Dec) in the run up to national International Day of Persons with Disabilities (3rd Dec). UNIQUE ran in An Meitheal to celebrate the newly
            opened Disability Service premises in Printing House Square. Our sincerest thanks to the artists and poets who have submitted their extraordinary work!</p>
        <p class="concept">The exhibition provided a web experience with a virtual web app to allow visitors to explore more about each piece. I developed the web app from Sep-Dec 2023 and it was available via QR code. </p>

            <p class="concept">A guidelines document was compiled after reviewing the Inclusive practices of 100 graduate recruiters. These were selected based on some of the following factors. Employers with a high amount of Trinity alumni. Employers with good reputations
                for disability inclusion. Employers who engage well with university recruitment. Employers of interest to Trinity careers consultants. The inclusive practices of graduate recruiters were divided into 5 areas of interest and reviewed. Emphasis
                was put on a disabled student perspective, i.e. how inclusive an recruiter appears to a disabled student when researching and applying for a graduate role. Following the review, general advice was compiled based on the findings. The review
                was conducted by disabled students. The result is a “Dos and Don'ts” style document which should be used by employers to review and improve their graduate recruitment practices. The document attempts to summarise the indicators a student
                will look for in a company. It is targeted towards employers, specifically those who actively recruit graduates.</p>
